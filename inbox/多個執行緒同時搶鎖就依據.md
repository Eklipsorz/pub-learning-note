問題：
> Two threads can reach lock.acquire() at the exact same time. What happens then?

> One of them gets the lock first and the other must wait until the first one releases the lock. If they reach acquire at the exact same time, the mechanism that decides which one gets the lock is heavily hardware dependent.

重點：兩個執行緒共同存取同個資源，其中會使用鎖
- 當其中一個執行緒A先鎖，另一個執行緒B就必須等到執行緒A做完並釋放鎖
- 如果兩個執行緒同時間執行鎖，會依據著硬體資源以及其效能給予來決定哪一個執行緒能夠先鎖


> I should point out though that there is no such thing as "at the exact same time". To have two things that occur in different threads happen at the exact same time would require there to be some global notion of time in which operations are ordered. There is no such thing.

重點：
- 沒有任何東西會
- 為了讓那兩個執行緒上的

> Also, the concept of when a thread will "reach" an operation also isn't well defined. Operations don't take place instantaneously and operations can overlap with other operations.

執行緒何時執行(reach)到該指令(operation)也沒很好地定義，這些指令不會立即被執行以及會與其他指令重疊著執行
