## 描述

[[@mdnClassesJavaScriptMDN]]
> The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class. Static members (properties and methods) are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance. Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application, whereas static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances. 


[[@mdnStaticMethodMDN]]
> A static method (or static function) is a method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.

> In a Web API, a static method is one which is defined by an interface but can be called without instantiating an object of that type first.
>
> Methods called on object instances are called instance methods. 


[[@khanacademyStaticFunctionsVs]]
> A "static" function is a function that is defined on an object, but it doesn't change properties of the object. So why even define it on the object? Typically, it has something to do with the object, so it is logical to attach it to it. It treats the object more like a namespace.
