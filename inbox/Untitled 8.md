## 描述



Is it allowed, yes it’s allowed.

Is it recommended? No it’s not recommended to use underscore in an URL.

Underscore would lead to Complex URLs, it can cause a problems for crawlers by creating unnecessarily high numbers of URLs that point to identical or similar content on your site. As a result, some crawler may consume much more bandwidth than necessary, or may be unable to completely index all the content on your site.

So basically, if you use underscore:

It would be slower for crawler to go to your site (URLs)
It consume more bandwidth.
I’d recommend to use hyphens (-), instead of underscores (_) in your URLs.

Here are a few pros in favor of the hyphens (-):

Recommended by Google over underscores (source).
Familiar to end user.
Easier to write (doesn’t need Shift)
It felt more native in the context of URLs as they are allowed in domain names.
Hopefully that answer the question.
