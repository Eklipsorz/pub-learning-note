## 描述



### webpage
[[@WebPageWikipedia]]
> A web page (or webpage) is a hypertext document on the World Wide Web. Web pages are delivered by a web server to the user and displayed in a web browser

重點：
- webpage 或者 page 本身會是指在網頁能夠呈現的hypertext 文件
- webpage 通常會是由網頁伺服器提供客戶端，並由客戶端解析並呈現成畫面




### SPA (Single Page Application)

> The core difference between a SPA and a MPA is that with a single-page application, all the requests happen within the lifecycle of a single HTML page. You might be able to see different views, even see different "pages" of the application, but all the rendering takes place within a single HTML web page. This has the advantage of keeping the state of the "application" all in one scope.


重點：
- Single Page Application 是以一個webpage 檔案為主體，並搭配著
