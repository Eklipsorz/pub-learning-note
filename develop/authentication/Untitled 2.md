> What Is an ID Token?

> An ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let's take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.


ID token 是一個用來證明使用者是受過認證的資訊，其概念是由OIDC 這個驗證標準。

> Here, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application.

在這裡，使用者會會透過他們的瀏覽器來對openid provider進行驗證並獲取網頁應用程式的存取權限

> The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.

基於OpenID Connect的認證程序的結果就是ID token，它會以作為被驗證的使用者證明來轉遞給應用程式

> This provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user's authentication. Let’s see some other details.

這提供一個最基本的id token 概念：
- 使用者驗證證明

> An ID token is **encoded as a JSON Web Token** (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it

- id token 是使用JWT 技術來編碼，一個標準格式來允許你的應用程式輕易獲取內部內容並確保token的發行人是誰以及沒有人能夠改變JWT


> To put it simply, an example of ID token looks like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vbXktZG9tYWluLmF1dGgwLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6ImF1dGgwfDEyMzQ1NiIsImF1ZCI6IjEyMzRhYmNkZWYiLCJleHAiOjEzMTEyODE5NzAsImlhdCI6MTMxMTI4MDk3MCwibmFtZSI6IkphbmUgRG9lIiwiZ2l2ZW5fbmFtZSI6IkphbmUiLCJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSI6IkRvZSJ9.bql-jxlG9B_bielkqOnjTY9Di9FillFb6IMQINXoYsw
```

> Of course, this isn't readable to the human eye, so you have to decode it to see what content the JWT holds. By the way, the ID token is not encrypted but just Base 64 encoded. You can use one of the many available libraries to decode it, or you can examine it yourself with the jwt.io debugger.


> Without going deeper into the details, the relevant information carried by the ID token above looks like the following:

```json
{ 
  "iss": "http://my-domain.auth0.com", 
  "sub": "auth0|123456", 
  "aud": "1234abcdef", 
  "exp": 1311281970, 
  "iat": 1311280970, 
  "name": "Jane Doe", 
  "given_name": "Jane", 
  "family_name": "Doe"
}
```

> These JSON properties are called **claims**, and they are **declarations about the user** and the token itself. The claims about the user define the user’s identity

這些JSON屬性被稱之claim ，他們是宣告使用者的資訊和token資訊，


aud => token的接收者，會用特定獨特識別字來表示特定使用方，


    Actually, the OpenID Connect specifications don't require the ID token to have user's claims. In its minimal structure, it has no data about the user; just info about the authentication operation.

實際上來說，OpenID Connect 規格書不需要ID token 去擁有使用者的資訊，在最小的token架構中，是token內的資訊是沒有任何有關於使用者資訊，就只是關於驗證操作的資訊。


> One important claim is the aud claim. This claim defines the audience of the token, i.e., the web application that is meant to be the final recipient of the token. In the case of the ID token, its value is the client ID of the application that should consume the token.

最重要的claim是aud claim，這定義token的audience，換言之就是網頁應用程式

在ID token的情況，它的值會是能夠使用這個token的client_id。


    Remember this small detail about the audience claim because it will help you better understand what its correct use is later on.

> The ID token may have additional information about the user, such as their email address, picture, birthday, and so on.


id token 可能擁有額外資訊來包含使用者資訊，如email、圖片、生日。

> Finally, maybe the most important thing: the ID token is signed by the issuer with its private key. This guarantees you the origin of the token and ensures that it has not been tampered with. You can verify these things by using the issuer's public key.

最後：

> Cool! Now you know what an ID token is. But what can you do with an ID token?

> First, it demonstrates that the user has been authenticated by an entity you trust (the OpenID provider) and so you can trust the claims about their identity.


> Also, your application can personalize the user’s experience by using the claims about the user that are included in the ID token. For example, you can show their name on the UI, or display a "best wishes" message on their birthday. The fun part is that you don’t need to make additional requests, so you may get a little gain in performance for your application.





id token：可以拿來做什麼？
1. 由於驗證使用者是合法的實物，所以你可以信任他們所說的事情
2. 你的應用程式可以藉由增加更多使用資訊在token內來替應用者增加使用者體驗，比如你可以在特定UI展現出名字。

>  從 OAuth 2.0 到 OpenID Connect

> 但是解決了一個問題，新的問題就又跑出來了。

> 因為 OAuth 2.0 的便利性，就出現了很多將 OAuth 2.0 用為使用者登入驗證方式的服務。 但大家千萬不能忘記 OAuth 2.0 只是一個定義如何使用 Access Token 來授權的協議，內容是沒有提到如何去認證一個使用者的登入。因此如果使用 OAuth 2.0 做為使用者登入的認證機制，就會有很多意想不到的[資安問題](http://www.thread-safe.com/2012/01/problem-with-oauth-for-authentication.html)發生。而再次的有人想出了一個在現有 OAuth 2.0 的協議基礎下發放 ID Token 的方法來解決這個問題，這就是我們今天的主題所討論的 OpenID Connect。

> ## 重新介紹今天的主角 -- OpenID Connect

![](https://hennge.com/tw/blog/1_SQQwKPMtjPJbUKP2Z0R_Aw.png)

> 因為 OpenID Connect 是以 OAuth 2.0 為基礎設計，因此使用方法上有很多的相似處。角色也是其中一個，只是在 OpenID Connect 中的 Client 有了一個新稱呼叫 Relying Party。Authorization Server 的新稱呼為 OpenID Provider，它除了可以發放 Access Token 外，同時也可以發放 ID Token。


### 驗證方式

[[@auth0ValidateIDTokens]]

> If any of these checks fail, the token is considered invalid, and the request must be rejected.

> 1. Validate the JWT.

> 2. Check additional standard claims. If you've performed the standard JWT validation, you have already decoded the JWT's Payload and looked at its standard claims. Additional claims to verify for ID tokens include:
		- Token audience (aud, string): The audience value for the token must match the client ID of the application as defined in your Application's Settings in the Client ID field.
		- Nonce (nonce, string): Passing a nonce in the token request is recommended (required for the Implicit Flow) to help prevent replay attacks. The nonce value in the token must exactly match the original nonce sent in the request. See Mitigate Replay Attacks for details.



###  claim 命名緣由
claim：
> a statement that something is true or is a fact, although other people might not believe it

重點：
- 以特定角度來說明特定事物是對的描述，但對於其他人來說可能會不相信
