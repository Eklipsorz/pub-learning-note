## 描述


### log in
> **Log in**

> Let us begin with the **phrasal verb** “log in.” This expression means to gain permission to use a computer system. Logging in usually requires a username and password. When a user logs in, the computer system keeps a record, or “log,” of that user’s **session** on the system. We can also use the single word “login” as a noun to describe such a session on a computer.

重點：
- log in 是電腦科學所創造的用語，主要是指提供使用者名稱和其對應密碼來依此進入特定電腦系統來獲取權限
	- log 本身是指正式紀錄特定事物，而在電腦系統當中，只要提供使用者名稱和其對應密碼來進入，電腦系統會以session形式來 **正式將使用者進入的過程** 來記錄在系統裡頭，也就是說 log in 本身行為就是將特定使用者(相關)資訊寫入至系統當中。

### sign in

> **Sign in**

> We can use the phrasal verb “sign in” in the same way as “log in.” But unlike “log in,” “sign in” is common outside of the computer world. As part of security measures in an office building or school, you may have to provide information about yourself before you enter. That could mean writing your name (or “signing” your name) on a paper or showing an identity card. This creates a record of visitors to a place.

重點：

####  log 命名緣由

重點：
- log 是動詞，主要是指正式地紀錄特定事物

#### sign 命名緣由

> to write your name, usually on a written or printed document, to show that you agree with its contents or have written or created it yourself

重點：
- sign 是動詞，主要是指在文件寫上自己名字以表明自己同意特定事情。
