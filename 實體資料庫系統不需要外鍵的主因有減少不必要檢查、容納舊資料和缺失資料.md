> ## Why databases don't have foreign keys?


> ### 1. Performance
> Having active foreign keys on tables improves data quality but hurts performance of insert, update and delete operations. Before those tasks database needs to check if it doesn't violate data integrity. This is a reason why some architects and DBAs give up on foreign keys at all. This is especially the case in data warehouses and analytical databases that do not process data in a transactional manner (one row at a time) but in bulk. And performance is everything in data warehousing and business intelligence.


重點：
- 在實體資料庫系統強加外鍵設定，會使得該系統在每一次對資料操作時都會檢查操作是否會違反資料完整性、資料一致性
- 會觸發檢查的操作為建立、編輯、刪除等
- 在確定後續的資料操作並不會真的違反資料完整性、資料一致性 或者 資料上不需要這兩個性質的情況下，每一次資料操作就檢驗就會顯得多餘且浪費成本。



### 老舊資料
> ### 2. Legacy data
> Many databases when they were designed required to store legacy data from the older databases and sources which may not have been so strict on data quality and integrity. To be able to contain old dirty data architect had a choice of a) cleansing and transforming legacy data (expensive exercise) or b) give up on enforcing referential integrity on the database level. Some packaged ERP and CRM applications also use this approach.

> ### 3. Full table reload
> Some databases, like data warehouses, staging or interfacing databases, require for the data to be often reloaded from external sources. This causes the data to be inconsistent at the time of reloading (child table may be fully loaded while parent table is empty). That could be bypassed by disabling keys for the time of the reload. However, this introduces additional logic and complexity and another point of failure. And as mentioned above, has a negative effect on performance. Often, costs outweigh benefits and developers just don't bother with the keys.



> ### 4. Higher level framework
> Some applications use programming frameworks that make another logical layer on top of physical databases. Developers don't use _insert_ or _update_ statements to modify data but use an API, or the framework does everything in the background. This is the case in **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks or frameworks like **Ruby on Rails**. Those tools take care of the referential integrity and together with RDBMS create a higher level database engine. Those frameworks can create database tables themselves and not always create foreign keys. Developers using such tools, rarely interfere with automatically generated schema and leave it without the keys.


> ### 5. Cross database relations
> This one is not the right reason why database doesn't have foreign keys but why it might be missing some. Some databases span across more physical databases and even engines, and it might not be technically possible to create keys that span across databases. SQL Server is a good example here - it doesn't enable creating keys across two databases on the same server. And this architecture is common in larger scale systems.


> ### 6. Database platform agnostic
> Similar to the previous one, some applications were designed to be database platform (DBMS) agnostic and to be able to work on various databases like Oracle, SQL Server, DB/2 or Sybase. This is what I've read about **PeopleSoft** (currently owned by Oracle). Designers didn't want to tie to any particular platform and pushed all the logic to the application layer leaving database layer as plain as possible.


> ### 7. Open for change
> Sticking with Oracle, another story I've heard about its applications, this time its own child - **Oracle E-Business Suite** - is that it was designed to be as customizable as possible. Oracle provided a solid foundation and left implementation teams elasticity to decide on as many aspects of the design as possible. At least this is what _they_ say. Maybe the reason was the same as in the previous point or was it the next one:


> ### 8. Lazy architect
> When you are creating a database, and you want to store data you need to create some tables and columns. This is a minimum. But you don't have to create structures that keep data consistency, like primary, unique, foreign keys or constraints. It requires some effort and has no immediate benefit. Some of the architects and DBAs just ignore that part.


> ### 9. Keep model a secret
> Maybe this one is far fetched, but maybe sometimes it is because people don't want other to have it too easy and know too much. People, in general, want to be needed and irreplaceable. A perfect self-explanatory design might make them obsolete. But this is just my theory.
