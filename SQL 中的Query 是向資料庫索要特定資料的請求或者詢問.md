## 描述
[[@martingibbsWhatQuerySQL]] 所描述：
> A **query** is really a question or request for data. For example, ''Tell me how many books there are on computer programming'' or ''How many Rolling Stones albums were produced before 1980?'' When we query databases, we can use a common language to get the information. **Structured Query Language SQL)**, is a fairly universal language. There are some different flavors, but once you know the basics you can easily adapt your questions.


> The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition ([schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema "Database schema") creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a [declarative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming") ([4GL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4GL "4GL")), it also includes [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming") elements.
