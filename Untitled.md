> Overlay means to cover the surface of something with a coating. In other words, it is used to set one thing on the top of another. The overlay makes a web-page attractive, and it is easy to design.

> Creating an overlay effect means to put two **div** together at the same place, but both will appear when required. To make the second div appear, we can hover or click on one div. In these two divs, one div is the overlay div that contains what will show up when the user hovers over the image, and the second div is a container that will hold both the image and its overlay.
