[[@wikidataProxyServer2022]] 所描述：
> In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

[[@ReverseProxy2022]] 所描述：
> Reverse proxies are typically owned or managed by the web service, and they are accessed by clients from the public Internet. In contrast, a forward proxy is typically managed by a client (or their company) who is restricted to a private, internal network, except that the client can ask the forward proxy to retrieve resources from the public Internet on behalf of the client.
